		<p> Press on the tail to see it flying like a bumerang.</p>
		<p> Press under the belly or on the eyes (when the animal is standing) to get him to lay down.</p>
		<p> Press on the eyes (when animal is laying down) to put him to sleep.</p>
		<p> When animal is asleep don't bother to ask for the animations, because sleep is important for animal's brain. Wake him up if you want to play with it. </p>
		<p> Press anywhere on the canvas to wake the animal up or restart animal's life. Wait a little bit, animal needs to turn his brain on.</p>
		<p> Don't do two animations at once, animals cannot split themselves. Do not be cruel to the animal. If anything happened just refresh the page and it will continue (with "Restart the page" button). </p>
